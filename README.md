This repository is a work in progress datapack for Minecraft Java Edition. 

This datapack will be a space exploration datapack, (I know it's been done a million times before, but I think my idea is unique enough to justify it) 
Ill be taking inspiration from a game called starbound, but I still want this to be my own project with my own ideas. I plan to completely remove the fantasy theming of vanilla minecraft and replace it with a sci-fi theme. I'll add tons of planets and a spaceship to fly between them.
I want to push the limits of datapacks, so if something can be changed it will be changed.
custom recipies, advancements, worlds, textures, ect.
ill add a whole custom tool system, and encounters with pirate spaceships, and quests from npc's, and more things as I think of them
